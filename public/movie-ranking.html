              height="200"
              alt="collage of a baseball game set underwater"/>
         </a>
    <p>One of my first photoshops done in class.. the assignment was to create a collage using a given word. My word was Underwater. 
        It started out as a simple underwater baseball scene and i thought what if it was actually inside an aquarium in a doctors office. 
        Of course there then needed to be a child pressed against the glass to see what was going on.

    <h3>Our Kitchen</h3>

                 alt="poster of two friends posing with vladimir lenin"/>
        </a>
    <p>This was a project I started before and after taking a photoshop class. I was struggling with alot of the finer details before taking the class. 
        After taking the class I'm really proud of the work and progress i had made. It currently hangs proudly in our kitchen as a reminder that everything
        insde the pantry and refridgerator belongs to the collective.

        </a>
    <p>Final version of a school project. The assignment was to create a movie poster. I decided to create a poster for a fictional movie called the 
        ghost of le verre. it was a story i made up for a table top rolling playing game called "Dread" and wanted to give the players something to 
        get excited about
